RELEASE DASHBOARD
=================
This shows the current open and closed tickets for all coming releases.
The open tickets distinguishes between bug and feature tickets.


Build the dashboard
-------------------
To build the dashboard, install elixir and then run

    make build


Configure the dashboard
-----------------------
Create a Jira token that can access the JQL used in the dashboard. It
needs to be able to use the "approximate-count" REST API end point and
thus needs "read:jira-work".

Put the Jira token in:

    config/reldash.token

Also configure the releases that should be queried, together with
release date. This is an erlang file that is consulted, i.e. it has
lines with tuples of releases and dates as strings, which end with a
dot, like so:

    {"unix", "1970-01-01"}.
    {"debian-0.9", "1994-01-26"}.

The order in this file is the order the dashboard will present the
releases.

Put the releases configuration in:

    config/active-releases.txt


Run the dashboard
-----------------
To run the dashboard in development mode

    make run-dev

To run in production

    make run
